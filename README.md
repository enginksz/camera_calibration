# camera_calibration

Geometric camera calibration, also referred to as camera resectioning, estimates the parameters of a lens and image sensor of an image or video camera. You can use these parameters to correct for lens distortion, measure the size of an object in world units, or determine the location of the camera in the scene. These tasks are used in applications such as machine vision to detect and measure objects. They are also used in robotics, for navigation systems, and 3-D scene reconstruction.
